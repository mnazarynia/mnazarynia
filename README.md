ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mnazarynia

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about AI, Python development, and physics.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m deepening my machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and Python skills.

As a physicist and software developer, I use Python extensively in research and development projects. 
My expertise spans Mcload, XRD, PVD, SEM, and laser systems, 
where I design solutions for medical applications and optimize performance using Python.
